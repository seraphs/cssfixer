A webapp for adding/deleting entries from our graphserver databases (staging, production)

It can be accessed at the root of the hosting url :5000 or also with API calls:

GET

/branches -- redirects to / and includes table view of branches in the db
/machines -- redirects to / and includes table view of machines in the db

adding ?format=json to the GET urls will provide json of the id/name for a branch or machine

POST

/branches
    * accepts 'id' and 'branch_name' for a branch and _method = 'delete' and removes that branch from db if exists
    * accepts a unique 'branch_name' and _method = 'insert' and adds that branch name to the db
/machines
    * accepts 'id' and 'machine_name' for a machine and _method = 'delete' and removes that machine from db if exists
    * accepts the following to add a machine to the db:
        ** unique 'machine_name' (string)
        ** 'os_id', 'is_throttling', 'cpu_speed', 'is_active' (numeric)
        ** _method = 'insert'

DELETE

/branches
